# Portfolio Website

## Description

This project is my first portfolio website, created during the first week of my web development course. It's a result of experimenting with *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript* and serves as a central hub to showcase my work, skills, and provide easy ways to connect with me.

The website includes:
- **My CV**: Visitors can view and download my CV.
- **Project Summaries**: Highlights of my latest two projects, including direct links to their GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Information**: Direct links to email and LinkedIn for quick and easy communication.
- **GitHub Profile**: A link to the homepage of my GitHub account to explore more of my work.

This has been a fun and rewarding project, and I look forward to improving it as my skills grow!

## Features
- A clean and professional design.
- Fully responsive layout for an optimal viewing experience on all devices.
- Direct links for:
  - Viewing and downloading my CV.
