            <br/>
            In my free time, I live with my two cats and my partner. 
            I enjoy spending time in my van, working out at the gym, travelling both within Sweden and internationally, and being outdoors where I love hiking, cycling, camping, and swimming. 
            I am also passionate about improving my coding skills and growing as a developer.
